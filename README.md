# shell
Features:

Emulates basic Windows CMD appearance and prompt style
Implements common built-in commands:

dir - List directory contents
cd - Change directory
cls - Clear screen
copy/move - File operations
echo - Display messages
help - Show command help
and many more!


Supports environment variables with %VAR% syntax
Customizable prompt using Windows-style prompt codes
Attempts to execute external system commands when built-ins aren't found

How to Use:

Run the Python script
You'll see a Windows-like command prompt
Type commands just like in CMD (e.g., dir, cd documents, etc.)
Type help to see available commands or help command for specific help
Use exit to quit the emulator

This emulator runs on your actual file system, so be careful with file operations like delete, move, etc.
